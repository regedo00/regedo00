## Hello there, I'm Edo ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about technology and work with startups, focusing on fundraising through syndicates.

Iâ€™m currently the Managing Director at [ClubDeal Digital](https://www.linkedin.com/company/clubdeal-digital/), an Italian wealth tech company. ClubDeal Digital offers sophisticated tools for managing private asset investments, as well as syndicate creation and ESOP management, catering to startups, corporates, and investors.

In the past few years, I've been the Head of Growth at [BacktoWork](https://www.backtowork24.com)(backed by the first Italian Bank Intesa Sanpaolo). BacktoWork is a platform that enables Italian startups to secure funds from retail and HNWI investors through syndicates and community rounds.
