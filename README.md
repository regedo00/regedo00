## Hello there, I'm Edo 👋

I'm a fintech professional, a tech enthusiast, and a self-taught Python programmer from Italy.

Currently, I serve as the Head of Growth at [BacktoWork](https://www.backtowork24.com), a platform with the mission to support Italian startups in raising funds from retail and HNWI investors through syndicates & community rounds.

If you're beginning your startup fundraising journey and don't know where to start, I recommend checking [this repo](https://github.com/regedo00/trw-startup-resources) with free resources!
