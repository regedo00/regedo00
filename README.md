## Hello there, I'm Edo ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technology enthusiast with a deep understanding of startups and fundraising, particularly through syndicates and community rounds.

Iâ€™m currently the Managing Director at [ClubDeal Digital](https://www.linkedin.com/company/clubdeal-digital/). As an Italian wealth tech company, we provide sophisticated tools for managing private asset investments, catering to entrepreneurs, high-net-worth individuals, business angel clubs, and family offices.

Over the past few years, I served as the Head of Growth at [BacktoWork](https://www.backtowork24.com), a crowdinvesting platform (backed by Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo) with the mission to empower Italian startups in raising funds from retail and HNWI investors through syndicates & community rounds.

Don't miss my [â˜•Tech Readings of the Week](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/%E2%98%95tech-readings-of-the-week-7039008827605692416/) newsletter on LinkedIn, where I curate a mix of insightful articles, reports and educational resources. Every Sunday morning.
